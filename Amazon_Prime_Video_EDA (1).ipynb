The release year distribution shows a steady growth in Amazon Prime’s content acquisition over time, with a notable surge in recent years—likely reflecting the platform’s increasing investment in original content and licensing deals. The content is predominantly targeted at audiences aged 16+ and 18+, with relatively fewer titles for younger viewers, indicating a preference for more mature themes.**\n",
